This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: data type mismatch in arithmetic operations. The bug.cob file contains the erroneous code. The bugSolution.cob file shows the corrected version with proper data type handling. The main issue lies in the use of numeric data types and the correct handling of values during arithmetic operations in COBOL. Incorrect data type usage can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
